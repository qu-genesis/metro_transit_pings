  schedule:
#     Run every 5 minutes from 8:00 AM to 9:10 AM Central Time (Mon-Fri)
#     Note: GitHub Actions uses UTC, so we need to convert:
#     8:00 AM CT = 2:00 PM UTC (during CDT) or 3:00 PM UTC (during CST)
#     9:10 AM CT = 3:10 PM UTC (during CDT) or 4:10 PM UTC (during CST)
    
#     We'll run from 2:00-4:15 PM UTC to cover both DST scenarios
#     Pattern: minute hour * * day-of-week
    - cron: '*/5 14-16 * * 1-5'  # Every 5 min, 2-4 PM UTC, Mon-Fri

  # Allow manual triggering for testing
